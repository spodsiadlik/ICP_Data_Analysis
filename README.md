# ICP_Data_Analysis
This is my Data Analysis Project for PHYS 2320: Introduction to Computational Physics!

For this project, we chose to analyze voltage and current data of a discharging 9-Volt battery that we had gathered from the Microcontrollers course. We first plotted the data using the matplotlib library to physically see the discharge and compare it to what we expected. Then, we used the data to find the overall capacity of an average 9-Volt battery, and compared it with the information provided by the manufacturer, Energizer. This served as our final for Dr. Lusk's Introduction to Computational Physics course for Spring 2023.
